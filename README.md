Problem Statement:
Driving under the influence of alcohol continues to be a significant public safety concern, leading to a high number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities worldwide. Despite strict laws and awareness campaigns, incidents of drink and drive continue to occur, posing a threat to not only the individuals involved but also to other road users. Traditional methods of enforcement, such as random breath tests, have limitations in terms of coverage and efficiency, making it imperative to develop an advanced solution.
The challenge is to create an Alcohol Detection System that effectively identifies drivers who are operating vehicles under the influence of alcohol. This system should be based on microcontroller technology and should have the capability to detect alcohol consumption accurately and swiftly in drivers. The solution should not only meet the technical requirements but also adhere to legal standards and ethical considerations. Developing an efficient, reliable, and cost-effective prototype is essential to address this critical issue and enhance road safety for everyone.
